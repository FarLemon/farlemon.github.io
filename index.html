            </div>

            <h3>Professional Summary</h3>
            <p>
                Completing the Computer Science program and developing this ePortfolio has allowed me to transform from a
                technically curious developer into a more disciplined and production aware developer. Throughout the
                program, I strengthened my understanding of software engineering principles, data structures and algorithms,
                database design, and security practices. The capstone experience required not only technical implementation but
                intentional evaluation, refactoring, and alignment with professional standards.
            </p>
            <p>
                This portfolio demonstrates my ability to design, analyze, enhance, and document computing solutions in a manner
                consistent with industry expectations. Each artifact included reflects growth in architectural thinking,
                scalability awareness, and maintainability.
            </p>

            <h3>Collaboration and Communication</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout the program, I developed the ability to communicate technical concepts clearly to different audiences.
                In coursework and project discussions, I learned to translate implementation details into structured explanations
                suitable for stakeholders and peers. The Informal Code Review included in this ePortfolio reflects this skill by
                presenting existing functionality, identifying areas for improvement, and explaining planned enhancements without
                unnecessary technical complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Collaboration in discussion threads strengthened my ability to discuss design tradeoffs, incorporate feedback,
                and iterate on solutions. These experiences shaped my approach to the enhancement process, where I carefully
                analyzed architectural decisions and refined them based on best practices.
            </p>

            <h3>Software Engineering and Design</h3>
            <p>
                The FFC-MacroButtons artifact demonstrates growth in software architecture and maintainability. Originally a
                tightly coupled userscript, it was refactored into a modular, configuration driven framework with clear separation
                of concerns. This enhancement reflects my ability to apply professional engineering principles such as modular
                design, deterministic behavior, extensibility, and documentation standards.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this process, I strengthened my ability to evaluate architectural weaknesses, decouple responsibilities,
                and design systems that scale beyond their original scope.
            </p>

            <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
            <p>
                Enhancement Two formalized the algorithmic structures behind configuration resolution and navigation. By applying
                hierarchical mappings, deterministic path resolution algorithms, Set based deduplication, ordered rendering logic,
                and stack based navigation, I demonstrated the ability to use appropriate data structures to solve contextual UI
                challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                This experience reinforced that algorithms are not isolated academic exercises, and are foundational to building
                predictable, maintainable, and scalable client side systems.
            </p>

            <h3>Database Design and Integration</h3>
            <p>
                The database enhancement transformed a basic data retrieval implementation into a production aware client database
                system. By replacing unbounded Firestore collection reads with structured, parameterized queries and cursor based
                pagination, I improved scalability, efficiency, and cost awareness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Abstracting database access into a dedicated service layer and synchronizing URL parameters with query constraints
                reflects professional architectural patterns used in modern web applications.
            </p>

            <h3>Security Mindset</h3>
            <p>
                A major growth area during this program has been developing a security focused mindset. In the database
                enhancement, I intentionally reduced the attack surface by avoiding full collection reads and structuring
                read only Firestore rules. I also considered how access patterns affect data exposure and scalability.
            </p>
            <p>
                This reflects an understanding that secure architecture is not an afterthought, but a foundational design
                consideration.
            </p>

            <h3>Integration of Artifacts</h3>
            <p>
                Together, the artifacts in this portfolio demonstrate a cohesive progression:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>The FFC-MacroButtons artifact demonstrates architectural discipline and modular engineering.</li>
                <li>The algorithm enhancement formalizes structured resolution and navigation logic.</li>
                <li>The database enhancement demonstrates scalable cloud integration and production aware design.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Collectively, they illustrate my ability to evaluate a system, improve its architecture, strengthen its
                performance characteristics, and consider security implications.
            </p>

            <h3>Professional Goals and Specialization</h3>
            <p>
                While I have not committed to a single specialization within computer science, I have developed a strong
                interest in software development across multiple domains. Throughout the program, I discovered that I enjoy
                building systems, refining architecture, and improving how applications behave.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rather than focusing narrowly on one path, I am intentionally exploring areas including frontend development,
                client server architecture, database integration, security systems, and much more. The artifacts in this portfolio
                reflect this breadth of interest. They demonstrate modular design, deterministic state handling, structured
                database access patterns, and security conscious engineering practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                My professional goal is to continue growing as a versatile software developer who can adapt to evolving
                technologies while applying strong foundational principles in software engineering, algorithms, database
                design, and security. This ePortfolio represents both the technical skills I have developed and the disciplined
                engineering mindset I will bring into my career.

        <!-- ENHANCEMENT ONE -->
        <section id="enhancement-1" class="card" aria-labelledby="e1-title">
            <div class="section-head">
                <h2 id="e1-title">Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering</h2>
                <p class="muted">Artifact: FFC-MacroButtons userscript</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Artifact Overview</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>FFC-MacroButtons</strong> is a Tampermonkey userscript created to inject macro buttons into webpages to
                automate repetitive tasks. The original script was created outside of coursework in mid to late 2025 and evolved
                organically to meet a usability need on a single website. While functional, the original implementation was tightly
                coupled to one site, which limited scalability, maintainability, and extensibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                The enhanced version refactors the userscript into a <strong>configuration driven framework</strong> capable of
                supporting multiple websites and reusable macro definitions. This refactoring introduces a clear separation of
                concerns between configuration data, site matching logic, and UI rendering.
            </p>

            <h3>Justification</h3>
            <p>
                This artifact was selected because it demonstrates advanced software design and engineering principles applied to a
                real world automation task. It provided a strong opportunity to improve architecture and code quality while
                maintaining practical functionality. The enhancement focuses on transforming a single purpose script into a scalable,
                reusable solution that aligns with professional software engineering practices.
            </p>

            <h3>Enhancements Implemented</h3>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Modular software architecture:</strong> Separated configuration, site matching/resolution, UI rendering,
                    and (future) execution logic so new sites and macros can be added without modifying core logic.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Configuration driven design:</strong> Added support for multiple configurations per site, shared
                    configurations across domains, and deterministic resolution of active macros.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Maintainable and extensible structure:</strong> Organized functions, constants, and styles for easier
                    debugging and future expansion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Professional documentation and readability:</strong> Improved maintainability with structured comments,
                    consistent naming conventions, and descriptive identifiers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>UI/UX improvements:</strong> Implemented sidebar navigation patterns (including elements like breadcrumbs
                    and hover feedback) to support intuitive navigation and visual accessibility.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                Although the userscript is not fully complete, the construction, organization, and documentation reflect
                professional practices expected for software engineering and design. This enhancement strengthened the artifact by
                shifting from tightly coupled, site specific logic to a scalable framework emphasizing modularity and separation of
                concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
                The refactoring process required careful analysis of the original code to identify tight coupling, redundant logic,
                and opportunities for improved modularity. Key learning included structuring a userscript to support multiple
                domains while maintaining deterministic behavior; implementing configuration inheritance and resolution strategies to
                support both global and path specific macros; designing UI elements (such as sidebar navigation and breadcrumbs)
                with usability and accessibility in mind; and balancing extensibility with simplicity to maintain long term
                maintainability.
            </p>
            <p>
                The biggest challenges were decoupling site specific logic from UI rendering and establishing a deterministic
                configuration resolution system. Working through these challenges reinforced best practices in software design,
                including modular architecture, separation of concerns, and code readability.
            </p>

            <div class="section-head">
                <h2 id="e2-title">Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
                <p class="muted">Artifact: FFC-MacroButtons userscript</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Artifact Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The selected artifact is the Tampermonkey userscript that dynamically injects configurable macro buttons into
                webpages based on the active domain and URL path. The script enables users to define context specific commands that
                adapt automatically as navigation changes. Originally submitted as part of Milestone Two for Software Design and
                Engineering enhancements, the artifact was designed with modular components and clear separation of concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
                This enhancement builds upon that foundation by formalizing and extending the <strong>algorithms and data
                structures</strong> that drive configuration resolution, navigation, and state management.
            </p>

            <h3>Justification</h3>
            <p>
                This enhancement focuses on the intentional application of algorithms and data structures to solve real world
                software problems—specifically, dynamic configuration resolution and hierarchical user interaction. While elements of
                these solutions were introduced during Milestone Two to support modular design, this milestone formalizes them as
                deliberate algorithmic choices rather than incidental implementation details.
            </p>
            <p>
                The enhancement emphasizes <strong>correctness</strong>, <strong>determinism</strong>, and <strong>maintainability</strong>,
                aligning the artifact with industry best practices for data driven UI behavior and controlled state management.
            </p>

            <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures Applied</h3>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Hierarchical mapping structures:</strong> A nested sitemap object maps domains and URL paths to
                    configuration identifiers, enabling efficient scoping of configurations and inheritance across path segments
                    without redundant definitions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Path resolution algorithm:</strong> The active URL is decomposed into constituent path segments and
                    traversed in a controlled order. Configurations are resolved from the most specific scope to the most general to
                    ensure deterministic behavior while supporting inheritance rules defined by configuration metadata.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Deduplication via Set structures:</strong> A <code>Set</code> is used during resolution to prevent duplicate
                    configuration applications while preserving priority ordering—ensuring correctness without unnecessary overhead.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ordered processing using arrays:</strong> Explicit ordering fields are respected when rendering macro
                    buttons and grouped commands, guaranteeing consistent execution and visual order regardless of how configurations
                    are merged.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Stack based navigation model:</strong> Navigation through nested macro groups is implemented using a stack,
                    allowing efficient forward traversal and reliable backtracking while maintaining a clear representation of the
                    user’s current context.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These choices were made to balance clarity, performance, and extensibility while remaining appropriate for a
                client side userscript environment.
            </p>

            <h3>Relationship to Milestone Two</h3>
            <p>
                The Software Design and Engineering enhancement completed in Milestone Two established the modular architecture
                required for this enhancement. Separation of concerns, centralized configuration handling, and isolated rendering
                logic made it possible to introduce structured algorithms without destabilizing the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                In particular, the refactoring of initialization logic and sidebar updates in Milestone Two enabled deterministic
                resolution and navigation algorithms to be layered cleanly on top of the existing design. This enhancement therefore
                represents a continuation and formalization of work begun in Milestone Two rather than an isolated redesign.
            </p>

            <h3>Standards, Best Practices, and Usability Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                The enhanced artifact aligns with software engineering best practices by using clearly defined data structures,
                predictable algorithms, and controlled state mutation. Variable naming, file naming, and versioning are consistent
                and descriptive, reducing cognitive load for future maintenance.
            </p>
            <p>
                From a usability perspective, deterministic ordering and stack based navigation provide intuitive interaction
                patterns. Users can reliably predict which macros will appear and how navigation will behave. Accessibility
                considerations include clear visual grouping, logical navigation flow, and minimal reliance on complex gestures or
                hidden state.
            </p>

                <h2 id="e3-title">Enhancement Three: Databases</h2>
                <p class="muted">Artifact: Grounded Creatures Web Application (Firebase Firestore + SolidJS)</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Artifact Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The selected artifact for the database enhancement is a web application developed to display structured data
                retrieved from Firebase Firestore. The application was originally created as a personal project to organize and
                display creature data from the game <em>Grounded</em>. It integrates a SolidJS frontend with a NoSQL cloud database
                (Firebase Firestore), retrieving creature documents and rendering them dynamically within a responsive interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                In its original implementation, the application performed unbounded collection reads using simple
                <code>getDocs()</code> calls and mapped the results directly to the UI. While functional for small datasets, this
                approach did not demonstrate optimized querying, scalability considerations, or refined access patterns appropriate
                for a production level system.
            </p>
            <p>
                This enhancement focuses specifically on improved database interaction, query efficiency, scalability, and
                reliability.
            </p>

            <h3>Justification</h3>
            <p>
                I selected this artifact because it provides a strong opportunity to demonstrate practical NoSQL database
                integration within a real world client application. Unlike coursework projects operating in controlled
                environments, this application interacts with a live cloud hosted database and therefore requires thoughtful query
                design and optimized access patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
                The original version demonstrated basic database connectivity. The enhanced version significantly expands database
                capabilities by implementing:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Structured Firestore queries with filtering and limits</li>
                <li>Pagination using document cursors (<code>startAfter()</code>)</li>
                <li>Separation of concerns through a dedicated service layer</li>
                <li>Controlled data transfer to reduce unnecessary reads</li>
                <li>Infinite scroll integration tied directly to database cursors</li>
                <li>URL driven filtering synchronized with database backed queries</li>
                <li>Error handling and fallback behavior</li>
                <li>Consideration of Firestore security rules for read only access</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The artifact was improved by replacing unbounded collection reads with structured, parameterized queries. Instead of
                loading the entire collection into memory, the application now retrieves documents in controlled batches (25 at a
                time), using cursor based pagination to support scalability. Alphabet based filtering was implemented using query
                constraints, and URL parameters were introduced to synchronize application state with database queries.
            </p>
            <p>
                These changes transform the project from a simple data display application into a scalable, production aware client
                database system.
            </p>

            <h3>Alignment With Course Outcomes</h3>

            <h4>Outcome 3 — Design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles and appropriate standards</h4>
            <p>
                This enhancement required evaluating several database trade offs, including:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Batch size versus performance</li>
                <li>Client side versus server side filtering</li>
                <li>Cursor based pagination versus offset based pagination</li>
                <li>Index requirements for range queries</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By implementing structured queries and cursor based pagination, I demonstrated an understanding of how database
                design decisions directly affect performance, scalability, and cost efficiency.
            </p>

            <h4>Outcome 4 — Use well founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices</h4>
            <p>
                This milestone demonstrates professional database integration practices by:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Abstracting Firestore access into a service layer (<code>creatureService.ts</code>)</li>
                <li>Implementing parameterized query logic</li>
                <li>Managing asynchronous data loading states</li>
                <li>Integrating <code>IntersectionObserver</code> for automated pagination</li>
                <li>Synchronizing UI state with URL parameters</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These improvements reflect real world architectural patterns used in modern client based applications.
            </p>

            <h4>Outcome 5 — Develop a security mindset that anticipates vulnerabilities and ensures privacy and data integrity</h4>
            <p>
                Although this application uses read only access, security considerations were explicitly addressed. The enhancement
                included:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Designing queries to retrieve only necessary data</li>
                <li>Reducing attack surface by avoiding full collection reads</li>
                <li>Structuring Firestore rules to explicitly permit read only operations</li>
                <li>Avoiding exposure of sensitive write operations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These considerations demonstrate an understanding of how database architecture interacts with security principles.
            </p>

            <h3>Reflection on the Enhancement Process</h3>
            <p>
                Through this enhancement, I learned that database expertise is not simply about retrieving data, but about designing
                efficient, scalable, and secure access patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most significant challenges was transitioning from simple collection reads to cursor based pagination.
                Implementing <code>startAfter()</code> required understanding how Firestore indexes and document snapshots function
                together. Integrating pagination with infinite scrolling also introduced asynchronous state management challenges,
                requiring careful control of loading flags and intersection observation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another challenge involved ensuring that URL parameters synchronized properly with database queries without causing
                redundant reloads. Implementing reactive state tied to query parameters strengthened my understanding of client side
                routing and state management in a data driven application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most importantly, this enhancement reinforced the importance of designing with scalability in mind. While unbounded
                reads may function for small datasets, they are not viable in real world systems. The enhanced design reflects a more
                professional, production aware approach to database integration.
            </p>
